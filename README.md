This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder along with its testbench. 
The adder_4bit module takes two 4-bit binary inputs (a and b) and a carry-in bit (cin), producing a 4-bit sum (sum) and a carry-out bit (cout).

The design is built structurally by connecting four 1-bit full_adder modules.
The testbench verifies the functionality of the circuit by applying various test cases and observing the outputs. 
This project provides a simple and clear example of structural modeling and basic digital arithmetic in Verilog
